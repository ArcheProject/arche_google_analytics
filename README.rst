Arche Google Analytics README
=============================

A very simple package to inject Google Analytics code
into an applicaton. It uses fanstatic to do the injection.

Currently the only configuration option for Pyramid based systems is:

arche_ga.key = [Your Google analytics key]


It's built as part of the Arche project, but it doesn't require it to work.

Feel free to suggest improvements.
